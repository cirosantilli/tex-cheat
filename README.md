# TeX Cheat

TeX information and cheatsheets.

Aims understand what TeX does in minute detail.

Most of this is not useful most of the time for end users who should use LaTeX instead. For a LaTeX cheatsheet see: <https://github.com/cirosantilli/latex-cheat>

LaTeX is a library built on top of TeX TODO: strictly a TeX library, or is there extra processing language features?

One major design goal of LaTeX is to separate content from form, as TeX itself is very low level, and not very useful for end users.

The base TeX system understands about 300 commands, called primitives, which are rarely used by end users.

TeX was created much earlier than LaTeX by Knuth in TODO. Leslie Lamport then built LaTeX on top of it in TODO.

TeX uses the extremely non-practical method of counting Pi digit as version numbers. The latest version as of 2014-03 is `3.14159265`, that is 9 digits, released updated 2014-01-12.

Knuth says that the TeX base should change as little as possible, and that:

> The absolutely final change (to be made after my death)" will be to change the version number to Pi, at which point all remaining bugs will become features.

Very good info: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX>

Google TeXbook for Knuth's TeX book: the de-facto standard. Fun to read (really), but a bit verbose.

TeX for the impatient is another good choice.
